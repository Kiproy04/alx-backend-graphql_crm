# 🧩 ALX Backend GraphQL CRM

## 📘 Overview
**ALX Backend GraphQL CRM** is a foundational Django project that demonstrates how to integrate **GraphQL** using the `graphene-django` library.  
This setup introduces the core concepts of GraphQL — defining schemas, creating queries, and connecting a GraphQL endpoint in Django.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To set up a **GraphQL endpoint** in Django and define the **first schema and query** that returns a static message.

---

## 📝Learning Objectives
Explain what GraphQL is and how it differs from REST.
Describe the key components of a GraphQL schema (types, queries, mutations).
Set up and configure GraphQL in a Django project using graphene-django.
Build GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and manipulate data.
Use tools like GraphiQL or Insomnia to interact with GraphQL endpoints.
Follow best practices to design scalable and secure GraphQL APIs.

---

## ✔Learning Outcomes
Implement GraphQL APIs in Django applications.
Write custom queries and mutations using graphene.
Integrate Django models into GraphQL schemas.
Optimize performance and security in GraphQL endpoints.
Explain when to use GraphQL instead of REST in real-world projects.
